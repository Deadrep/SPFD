Smart Pet Food Dispenser

• Designed and implemented a Smart Pet Food Dispenser using a Raspberry Pi, with a automated weighing system that controls the amount of food and delivery intervals while enabling customization.

• Python and its libraries were used to implement the user interface and all of the functionality into the RPi.

• The entire food dispenser and housing model for the RPi was designed in FreeCAD after measuring individual components. Ultimaker Cura was used to slice the 3D-model to obtain the gcode file to 3D print.
